<!--I missed the first 24 mins of class until:
Inline vs Internal/Embedded vs External css 
Why is external best? easy debugging, Reusability, Smaller, simpler HTML
Inline meaning inside the body itself, alongside the elements, its css is there.
Internal/Embedded meaning in the head, you have a <style>...</style>
External meaning using a source=file.css

External meaning faster loading, better, for multi page websites that use the same style elements 

Please look into conflicts! 
Inline > Internal > External > web browser default

span is inline element, div is block element. div meaning it does partitions. used for grouping elements.-->
