<!-- Box model:
represents the structure of an HTML element, including its content, padding, border, and margin.
<span>: inline element, used to style a part of the text without breaking the flow
<div>: block element, used to group elements

block level elements:
starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.

inline elements:
doesnt start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

CSS box model defines how elements are displayed and how they interact with each other in terms of spacing and layout.

rendered element occupies a box:
1. Content: The actual content of the element, such as text or images.
2. Padding: The space between the content and the border, providing inner spacing.
3. Border: The line surrounding the padding and content, defining the element's outer edge.
4. Margin: The space outside the border, separating the element from others.
all of these can be categorized as top, bottom, left and right

Position property:
1. Static: Default position, elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
2. Relative: Positioned relative to its normal position, allowing for adjustments without affecting the layout of other elements.
3. Absolute: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (not static), allowing for precise placement
4. Fixed: ALways in the same position
5. Sticky: Combines relative and fixed positioning, allowing the element to stick to a specified position when scrolling.

eg. div {
    position: relative;
    top: 10px;
    left: 20px;
}

Background property:
Length units:
1. Pixels (px): Fixed size, e.g., `width: 100px;

Relative length units: -->
