<!--we have semantic elements and advanced tags for your forms in html5 it seems. works well with CSS and JS APIs. we will do forms next week dw-->
<!--header, footer, article, nav, section, time, audio, video, output, etc is new in HTML5. its mainly for structural purposes. used in magazines, ebooks, etc-->
<!--header is not same as <head>, is on top. footer is on bottom, article can be defined within sections, etc. Nav has collection of links to other pages. Section is like a part or chapter in a book, content body it is.-->

<!--order and placement of these tags is decided by CSS. without css, theyre useless-->
