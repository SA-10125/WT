<!--attributes are added to input tags
    1. type (cause sometimes you need textbox and sometimes you need datetime.)
    2. ID (to identify which input is which)   
    3. Name (to identify which input is which but readable (i think. pl check)) 
    4. Value (used in stuff like buttons. if value=submit, thats the value (pl look into, am lil confused.))
    5. Size (like number of options visible.)
    6. Placeholder (like a hint of what to enter.)
    7. Min, Max (for numbers.)
    8. Selected (like if you want a box checked by default unless user unchecks it.)
